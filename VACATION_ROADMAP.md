# AutoScape vacation roadmap

All vacation work stays on `codex/vacation-safe-mode` and in its draft pull
request. Nothing in this roadmap authorizes merging, publishing, force-pushing,
deleting history, or changing GitHub Pages.

## Safety rules

- Preserve account, character, stats, inventory, bank, settings, and job-save
  compatibility.
- Keep every commit independently playable and reviewable.
- Run `npm test` before each push and keep GitHub Actions green.
- Stop and document uncertain persistence changes instead of guessing.
- Use original implementation and assets; do not copy proprietary game code or
  art.

## Progress

- [x] Add zero-dependency static regression tests for shipped JavaScript,
  offline assets, persistence safeguards, commands, navigation, banking,
  resource depletion, and synthetic click markers.
- [x] Run the regression suite automatically on the vacation branch and pull
  requests.
- [ ] Add browser-level smoke coverage for account creation, save/load, and
  basic UI controls.
- [ ] Profile the main loop and reduce avoidable bot, banking, and rendering
  work.
- [ ] Harden navigation, bank choice, banker interaction, and stall recovery.
- [ ] Expand command chaining and intent handling across gathering, processing,
  banking, combat, and supplies.
- [ ] Expand F2P items, equipment, monsters, NPCs, drops, shops, and skill loops.
- [ ] Improve mobile controls, accessibility, combat/loot balance, and death
  recovery.
- [ ] Complete final regression, compatibility, and manual play-test audit.

## Verification log

### Safety-net foundation

- `npm test`
- Node syntax validation for every inline application script and `sw.js`
- Manifest/app-shell consistency validation
- Static compatibility checks for immediate registration saves, 15-second
  checkpoints, cloned skill serialization, persistent command queues, disabled
  fatigue, stable-origin storage, connected navigation, nearest Lumbridge bank,
  timed resource depletion, and bot click-marker suppression
